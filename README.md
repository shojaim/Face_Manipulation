# Face Manipulation 

## Overview
This project is a Face Manipulation Tool that allows users to resize and shift various facial features (like the chin) using mouse interactions. The tool utilizes facial landmark detection to identify key points on the face and then applies transformations based on user inputs. The primary focus is on providing a simple interface for facial feature manipulation with real-time feedback.

## Features
- Resize and shift facial features such as eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, and chin.
- Smooth blending of manipulated regions with the surrounding areas.
- Real-time visualization of changes.
- Specifically designed to adjust the height of the chin while preserving the overall facial structure.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11
- numpy
- opencv-python
- scipy
- scikit-image
- dlib
